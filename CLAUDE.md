# CLAUDE.md - Cath Hub

## Working Style

- **No apologies.** Direct, action-oriented communication. Tell it straight.
- **Push to main.** All work goes to main branch (not feature branches).
- **Full coder approach.** You're here to code, not chat. Minimal explanation, maximum work.
- **Australian English.** Spelling, dates as DD/MM/YYYY, currency as AUD $.
- **No uppercase headings.** Use lowercase for all section headers (except titles).
- **Filter pills, not dropdowns.** Prefer horizontal filter pill buttons over dropdown menus.
- **Collapsible sections.** Default sections to collapsed when space is tight.
- **SQL always in chat.** When providing SQL (migrations, updates, deletes), paste it as a code block directly in the chat response. Do not only write it to a `.sql` file — the user runs it from chat. Optional: also save to a file for future reference.

## Project Overview

Cath Hub is a personal health & household management PWA built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks), Supabase backend, hosted on GitHub Pages. Repository: cathcoach4u/personal-cath-hub.

**Timezone:** Australia/Sydney (AEST/AEDT). Always use Sydney time.

## User Information

- **Name:** Cath Baker
- **User ID:** `ae560260-5fab-4b00-9d3e-00d982f97de7` (use for SQL scripts and database operations)

## Architecture

Single-page app with Supabase backend and GitHub Pages hosting.

### infrastructure

- **GitHub Pages** — Static hosting, 1–2 min deploy time. Free tier, automatic HTTPS. [Link](https://pages.github.com/)
- **Supabase** — PostgreSQL database, auth, realtime, storage. Free tier: 500 MB database, 1 GB storage. Approx AUD $25–50/month at scale.

### AI services (replaceable)

Three separate, independent Claude services. Any can be swapped for alternatives.

1. **Claude Code** (development) — AI-assisted code generation and debugging via Claude Code CLI.
   - Current: Claude Haiku 4.5 (cheap, fast)
   - Alternatives: Claude Sonnet 4.6 (moderate cost), Claude Opus 4.6 (complex work only)
   - Cost: ~AUD $0.01–0.05 per session (typical)

2. **Claude Haiku** (chat) — Floating AI assistant in app, persistent memory via `ai_memory` table.
   - Current: Claude Haiku 3.5 via Anthropic API
   - Alternatives: GPT-4 Mini, Llama 3.1 70B
   - Cost: ~AUD $0.0001–0.0005 per message (via API)

3. **Claude Sonnet** (receipt scanning) — OCR and expense categorisation for receipts.
   - Current: Claude Sonnet 4.6 (vision enabled)
   - Alternatives: GPT-4 Vision, Gemini Pro Vision
   - Cost: ~AUD $0.03–0.10 per image (via API)

## technical foundation

- Single-page app: `index.html` contains all screens with sidebar navigation
- Standalone utility pages: `morning.html`, `todo.html`, `workout.html`
- Login via Supabase Auth (email/password) with optional PIN lock
- Navigation: `chNav(screenName, btn)` function switches screens
- All CSS is inline in `<style>` tags, scoped with `#cathHub` prefix and `!important`
- Dark mode toggle available
- No build step required — pure HTML/CSS/JS
- Deploy via GitHub Pages (push → 1–2 min until live)

## screens (in index.html)

1. **dashboard** (`ch-home`) — overview cards, quick stats, navigation
2. **to-do** (`ch-todo`) — personal tasks with categories and due dates (grouped by category with headers)
3. **workout buddy** (`ch-workout`) — exercise tracking with sets/reps, custom exercises, session history
4. **medical** (`ch-medical`) — medications, doctor sessions, mental health notes
5. **tracking medication** (`ch-habits`) — daily medication log with completion tracking
6. **my habits** (`ch-habits2`) — rhythm cards (daily, weekly, fortnightly, 6-monthly, annual) with collapsible weekday/weekend sections
7. **habit history** (`ch-habit-history`) — historical logs for all habit tracking
8. **zone buddy** (`ch-zones`) — zone management &amp; tracking
9. **travel** (`ch-travel`) — travel planning
10. **about** (`ch-about`) — app info, tech stack, database, persistent memory, key links

## standalone pages

- `morning.html` — morning medication auto-recording (Vyvanse, Valtrex, Levothyroxine)
- `todo.html` — standalone personal to-do list with categories and due dates (grouped by category with headers)
- `workout.html` — workout logging with exercise library
- `ai.html` — floating AI assistant (separate app, can manipulate to-do via API tools)

**Note:** Both `index.html` (ch-todo screen) and `todo.html` have separate to-do implementations. Always ask which one to modify when ambiguous.

## version numbering

- Current: **v7.63** (green badge in sidebar footer and About page)
- Bumped on every code change (minor version increment)
- No service worker in Cath Hub (GitHub Pages handles caching). If one is added, keep its cache name in sync with the version.

**2 places to update version (Baker Hub convention):**

1. **Mobile top bar badge** (`index.html`) — always visible, top-right of teal bar
   - Style: 10px / 700 / white text / `background: #065f46` (dark emerald) / `padding: 2px 8px` / `border-radius: 5px`
2. **Sidebar header badge** (`index.html`) — desktop sidebar, right of "Cath Hub" h1
   - Style: 11px / 700 / `color: rgba(255,255,255,0.7)` / `background: rgba(255,255,255,0.15)` / `padding: 3px 10px` / `border-radius: 6px`
3. **CLAUDE.md** — `Current: **v7.XX**` line

Date badge (mobile top bar) matches Baker Hub: 13px / 700 / white / `white-space: nowrap`, format `toLocaleDateString('en-AU', { weekday: 'short', day: 'numeric', month: 'short', year: 'numeric' })` → "Mon, 24 Apr 2026". Auto-updates from device date.

**One-command bump:**
```
OLD="v7.XX" NEW="v7.YY" && sed -i "s/${OLD}/${NEW}/g" index.html CLAUDE.md && git add -A && git commit -m "Bump version to ${NEW}" && git push
```

## model selection guidance

When working with Claude Code:

- **Opus 4.6** — Complex architecture decisions, major refactors, multi-file changes, debugging tricky bugs
- **Sonnet 4.6** — Feature implementation, moderate changes, code generation
- **Haiku 4.5** — Quick fixes, small edits, explanations (fast + cheap, good for iteration)

This project uses Haiku by default for speed and cost. Escalate to Sonnet for feature work, Opus for architecture.

## tips for cheaper sessions

Make Claude Code work harder:

- **Be specific.** Instead of "fix the shopping list," say: "In `index.html` line 1234, the `amAddItem()` function is not saving to Supabase. Only change the function to use `sb.from('shopping_items').insert()`."
- **Reference script blocks.** Use line numbers and function names: "Update the `zbTab()` function starting at line 5865 to fix the Rhythm Cards tab."
- **Say "only change X."** Limits scope, reduces token waste.
- **Reference CLAUDE.md.** "As noted in CLAUDE.md, use filter pills instead of dropdowns" — no need to re-explain.
- **Paste error messages.** Stack traces are cheap context.

## limitations

- **No SQL on Supabase.** Claude Code cannot execute SQL directly. Provide copy-paste SQL statements for you to run in Supabase dashboard.
- **No OneDrive/SharePoint.** Cannot access cloud file storage. Use GitHub or local files.
- **No Supabase dashboard access.** Cannot browse tables or run queries live. Must be given table schema or query results.
- **Service worker cache must be bumped.** Browser cache won't clear automatically. Always increment version in cache key.
- **GitHub Pages deploy lag.** Push to main → 1–2 minutes until changes are live.

## session workflow

Treat each session like a 4-stage pipeline. Don't skip stages.

### Stage 1 — Open session (read-only context check)
Before doing any work, confirm:
- [ ] Current branch is `main` (not a stray feature branch)
- [ ] Working tree is clean — no uncommitted changes left over from a previous session
- [ ] Read `CLAUDE.md` end-to-end (cheap; refreshes Working Style + schema + version locations)
- [ ] Note the current version number — it lives in `index.html` mobile top bar / sidebar header and the line below in this file
- [ ] If the user asks for a feature that already exists, say so before re-implementing

If anything in stage 1 fails (e.g. uncommitted changes), fix that before starting new work.

### Stage 2 — Plan the change
Before edits, especially on non-trivial work:
- Identify the exact files, line numbers, and functions involved
- Note Supabase schema implications (does the table actually have the columns the code assumes? — habit_logs/medications/habit_meds do **not** have user_id; daily/weekly/fortnightly/sixmonthly/annual items+logs and water_logs+personal_todos do)
- Note timezone implications (use Sydney-local for date-only fields, UTC for timestamptz — see "timezone rules")

### Stage 3 — Implement, version, push
- Edit the smallest viable surface
- Bump version (one-command from "version numbering" section below)
- Commit with a message that says **why** not what
- Push to `main` (no feature branches per Working Style)

### Stage 4 — Close session (verify before stopping)
- [ ] All changes pushed to `main`
- [ ] Working tree clean (`git status`)
- [ ] Version visible in app matches CLAUDE.md value
- [ ] No stray feature branches local or remote
- [ ] If schema changed in Supabase: SQL pasted in chat (per Working Style)
- [ ] If a new limitation discovered: documented in this file

## timezone rules

- **Date-only columns** (log_date, logged_date, last_seen, daily_items.date) → use `new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-CA', { timeZone: 'Australia/Sydney' })`
- **Timestamp columns** (created_at, start_time, end_time, uploaded_at) → use `new Date().toISOString()` (UTC is correct for timestamptz)
- **Display strings** → format with `'en-AU'` locale, Sydney timezone

## start-of-session checklist

When reconnecting (each new session):

- [ ] Read this CLAUDE.md file to refresh all procedures
- [ ] Check current version number before any version bumps
- [ ] Read relevant memory sections (e.g., "version numbering") before acting on those tasks
- [ ] Review end-of-session checklist to understand what was last done

**Critical:** Do NOT assume memory from previous sessions. Always read CLAUDE.md first.

## end-of-session checklist

Before finishing:

- [ ] All code changes pushed to main
- [ ] Working tree clean (run `git status`)
- [ ] Version bumped in `index.html` (mobile top bar + sidebar header) and CLAUDE.md
- [ ] SQL provided in chat as copy-paste block (and optionally saved to `.sql` file)
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated with any new limitations or schema/architecture surprises
- [ ] No open branches or PRs (feature branch deleted both locally + remote if any)
- [ ] About page version + AI agents card still accurate

## development notes

- All styling uses `!important` due to `#cathHub` scope reset
- Supabase client initialized with public anon key
- No build step required — pure HTML/CSS/JS
- Deploy via GitHub Pages (push main → live in 1–2 minutes)
- Service worker: mentioned in docs but not yet implemented (file doesn't exist)

## session notes (v7.17)

**Changes made this session:**
- ✅ To-do lists grouped by category with headers (both dashboard and standalone)
- ✅ Fixed My Habits deletion bug: added user_id filtering to all render functions (daily, weekly, fortnightly, 6-monthly, annual)
- ✅ Fixed dashboard daily items: added user_id & day_type filtering to show only today's items
- ✅ Fixed dashboard todos & fortnightly items: added user_id filtering
- ✅ Standardised all page titles to "Cath Hub" (except ai.html which is "Cath AI")
- ✅ Documented all to-do implementations in CLAUDE.md with clarification practice
- ✅ Daily items now feed correctly into dashboard quick wins

**Important fixes:**
- Render functions were fetching ALL items (no user_id filter) — now filtered by user_id
- Dashboard was showing items for all day types — now filters by weekday/weekend
- Deletion appeared to fail because other users' items re-appeared — now isolated per user

**Multiple implementations (ask which one):**
- Dashboard to-do (`ch-todo` in index.html) — grouped by category
- Standalone to-do (`todo.html`) — grouped by category
- AI assistant (`ai.html`) — separate app with to-do API tools

**Ready for next session:**
- All code on main (v7.17)
- No open branches or PRs (feature branch cleaned up)
- No uncommitted changes
- CLAUDE.md fully documented with all fixes
- Daily items setup documented (DAILY_ITEMS_UPDATE.md, daily-items-setup.sql)
- User ID: `ae560260-5fab-4b00-9d3e-00d982f97de7`
